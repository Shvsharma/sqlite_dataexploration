Homework Assignment: Healthcare Data Exploration with SQLite and Pandas
Objective: explore a publicly available healthcare dataset, load it into a local SQLite database, and apply SQL queries using Python with Pandas. You will practice using SQLite, SQL queries, and Pandas for simple data exploration and analysis.

Using Healthdata.gov the two data sets I explored are: 1. https://data.cdc.gov/National-Center-for-Health-Statistics/DQS-Prescription-drug-use-in-the-past-30-days-by-s/b666-c5v5/about_data and 2. https://healthdata.gov/dataset/U-S-State-Life-Expectancy-by-Sex-2021/min8-nksx/about_data.

Perform SQL Queries Using SQLite and Pandas:
 
  Query 1: Using the prescription_drug_use data I selected all records based on individuals younger than 18 who used prescription drugs in the past 30 days. 

  Query 2: Using the same data set I counted the number of people who used prescription drugs in the past 30 days between the time period 2017-2020.

  Query3: Next I calculated the estimated total average of females wihtin the data set that have used prescription drugs in the past 30 days. 

  Query4: For this query I used the data set "life expectancy by sex" instead of my original data set due to the data being heavily analyzed prior and it being difficult to do any further statistical analysis. Using the new data set I sorted the records to show the top 5 states where female life expectancy is the highest.
